BAMAZON

A CLI store application that allows you to check inventory, select product, confirm price, and initiate purchase. The application is connected to a MySQL database and tracks inventory.
The user reviews and selects product, then enters the quantity they would like. Should stock be available, the purchase is allowed.  If no stock is available or quatity to be purchased is greater than the standing inventory, the purchase is not allowed. 

On successful checkout, the quantity purchased will be deducted from the inventory in the database and saved.

To start application, connect to server and run node bamazon.js in the terminal.
